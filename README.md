The goal of this project is to implement high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI). HDRI is a photography method that combines multiple exposures of the same subject matter with varying exposure levels to create more natural-looking and brightened images. HDRI as a topic has several different algorithms. In this project, we will utilize the Debevec-Malik algorithm, published at UC Berkeley by Paul E. Debevec and Jitendra Malik. Said paper is referenced at the end of this project.

The algorithm is a method to recover high dynamic range radiance maps from images taken using conventional imaging equipment. Using information from all the images, it fuses multiple photographs into a single, high-dynamic range radiance map. The pixels in the map have values proportional to true radiance values in the scene.

As a follow-up to implementing the HDRI algorithm, we will use RANSAC for homographies to eliminate the need for a tripod. We will use the RANSAC method for homographies to project all images onto a common plane and use HDRI to get a high-resolution aligned image.

Our goal is to separate the algorithm into easily digestible steps that make it simple to understand how the results are achieved.
